# TinyLittleDomain
(preliminary title)

## What is this?
There are many tools out there to find a proper domain name for your project. 
Most of them have one of them have one of the following two probems: 

1. They only search for "exact" matches, i.e. only for the exact domain name 
you entered
2. Some of the time, domain search data is sold to advertisers or companies 
that buy and park domains in order to make money. This results in your domain
being gone before you can actually use it

This project adresses the problem by providing a service where you can 
search for domains (and not just exact matches) while your privacy remains
intact. Only a minimal amount of data goes via the server side -- namely only
 the domains you are actually interested in. Furthermore, we will not look up
 anything unless you specifically ask us to -- by default we just make a DNS
 request to check if the domain is available.
